## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Jest
- JSDoc

### What I learned

In this project, I deepened my understanding of React, particularly how to use React with TypeScript and SCSS for better type safety and styling. I learned how to write tests using Jest to ensure the reliability of the application, and how to document my code with JSDoc for better maintainability. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing a light and dark mode feature, improving the user experience and accessibility.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working with React and deepen my knowledge of it. Additionally, I aim to further improve my testing skills and expand my understanding of accessibility to build more inclusive applications.
